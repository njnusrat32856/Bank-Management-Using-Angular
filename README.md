# Bank Management Project-Angular

Welcome to the Bank Management System project built in Angular using Json Server! This project is designed to provide a foundation for managing user banking operations using modern web technologies.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Overview

The Bank Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage various banking operations efficiently. This project is developed using Angular, offering a modern and dynamic user experience with a focus on modular architecture and real-time data handling. The application includes features to manage customer accounts and perform financial transactions, enhancing user productivity and operational workflows.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Angular: The primary framework for building the single-page application, providing modular structure, two-way data binding, and seamless updates.
- JSON Server: A quick and simple backend solution to simulate a REST API for testing and development purposes.
- HTML5: For structuring the web pages with semantic elements.
- CSS: Custom styling for an attractive and user-friendly interface.
- Bootstrap template: Used to create a responsive and mobile-friendly design with pre-designed components and grid layout.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
